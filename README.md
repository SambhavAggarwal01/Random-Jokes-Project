# RANDOM JOKES PROJECT
A Vanilla JavaScript Application for Creating Random Chuck Norris Jokes using Random Jokes API

This Application uses the concept of AJAX to fetch the data from the API.

Whenever the user Clicks the "Make Me Laugh Chuck Button", the picture of Chuck Norris Vibrates for a Random Amount of Time (between 0 &amp; 1 seconds). And along with it the Random Joke is Loaded &amp; Shown

The project also showcases various approaches for the AJAX request method, some of which is commented out along with their code for reference.
